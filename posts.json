The performance was good with assets in European sustainable funds down 10.6% in Q1 20 vs. a 16.2% decline in the overall European fund universe. Evidently, ESG and sustainable fund providers (yes even those who ask to be forgiven for investing in fossil fuels until very recently) have aggressively promoted this success. As for stocks, the S&amp;P Sustainable index outperformed overall S&amp;P by 0.9% over the last 3 months in $ terms, clearly benefiting the defensive qualities of such assets in a period of market turmoil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, the really striking data is to be found elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since inception in September 2007 until end of February 2020, the MSCI ACWI ESG leaders index (largely used in the market as a benchmark) returned 5.24% vs. 4.48% in the broad market. The interesting point here is that this data does not encapsulate March 2020 when sustainable and ESG funds did even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have seen the interest in sustainable investment clearly within our own activity too, during our recent crowdfunding campaign, we secured 300% beyond our target &#8211; that being pre-launch and during a global pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a deep dive and see whether outperformance is a happy coincidence or evidence of a long-term trend, to try to anticipate what the future may hold. Our conclusion is not only that sustainable investment is turning mainstream but that it has the basis for a sustained out-performance in the medium-term, irrespective of views on the environmental crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Why the strength of sustainable investment in the recent storm was rationale, not emotional<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 5 objective reasons why sustainable investment was a recent winner:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sustainable and ESG investment funds nearly always have low exposure to commodities, in particular, Oil &amp; Gas stocks, which were the worst hit during the market crash. So, as a result, sustainable investments were likely to outperform only by virtue of not being commodity-exposed.<\/li><li>Most sustainable and ESG funds entered the crisis with long healthcare and tech positions. Those were the two sectors that out-performed, which in turn compounded in performance terms the benefit of low exposure to commodities.<br>I would argue that these two points are pretty uncontroversial.<\/li><li>There is a correlation between the quality of management and the sustainability of the business model of companies. Typically, we see that companies whose management has for a long time prepared to pivot towards a more sustainable model ended up with a more resilient business model. This, in turn, protected them to an extent against a collapse of their markets. There is a growing body of academic studies showing a positive correlation between ESG factors and a Company\u2019s Financial Performance (CFP). More than 9 out of 10 companies show this positive correlation according to a recent Harvard research piece. By virtue of linking ESG and CFP, it is possible to establish materiality which is a key factor in our view.<\/li><li>It could also be argued that investors anticipated future political developments, with many countries putting the environment at the centre of their recovery programmes. Investors take a risk there but a limited one: calls to base future economic growth on cheap oil and gas have been muted. Investors were very rational in particular in light of the evidence provided by the CBI that clean investment accounted for 1\/3 of the economic recovery in the UK post the 2008-10 financial crash. In the next few years, investment opportunities in electric mobility and energy efficiency, to take two examples, could provide a drive towards economic recovery in two key sectors.<\/li><li>The collapse of commodity prices, in particular oil, could have been a very negative development making pollution cheaper than in the recent past. Yet again, investors took a very rational view: with oil demand likely never to fully recover from the current crisis (\u201cpeak oil\u201d), returns in the Oil and Gas industry are likely to collapse. A few years ago, E&amp;P would yield 25%+ returns, with Brent price below $30\/bbl, returns of renewables will at least match those of fossil fuel. Investors have anticipated the move.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>What about the medium to long term?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future is very positive sustainable investment. Let\u2019s take our five point format and see the rational arguments for sustainable vs. \u201ctraditional\u201d investment in the next decade:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Those long term reasons driving investors mentioned above, in particular, the link between ESG targets and financial performance will not disappear.<\/li><li>It is anticipated that billions if not trillions of investment money will leave fossil fuel\/ polluting industries and be redeployed towards sustainable investment. This will simply happen because investors want it. It is worth having in mind that, if $2.6trn of investment were moved towards clean energy by 2035 to meet the COP 21 climate change targets, this would imply that c10% of the money invested in pension funds in the western world would leave polluting investments and be redeployed towards cleaner options. A simple demand and supply equation that can only help the relative valuations of sustainable assets. Already $30bn of investment moved towards sustainable investment in 2018, a 30% rise vs. 2016. In the first four months of 2020, in the thick of the C-19 crisis, according to Morningstar $35bn found their way into the European sustainable fund universe, a 50% rise vs. the same period last year. At the same time, the outflow for the overall European fund universe was $170bn.<\/li><li>Economics. We argue above that more money will be thrown in by Governments, but to an extent, this money is not necessary: wind and solar + storage are now competitive with coal and gas. After years of investments, hydrogen and storage are becoming competitive too. These technologies will amplify the trend towards clean\/sustainable solutions not being a moral choice any longer but being the obvious choice based on an objective risk\/reward analysis. Which fund manager would want to be invested in a heavily polluting asset when a clean asset delivering the same level of returns is accessible? The risk analysis frameworks are changing quickly for fund managers: clean energy is a way to reduce risks now, not just to diversify.<\/li><li>As more and more evidence of the growing environmental crisis emerges, regulations will continue to get tougher with polluters and encouraging sustainable solutions. I see the current US administration as an aberration, not a show-stopper. Those who look at the US in detail know that clean energy is progressing quickly.<\/li><li>We are making progress so that the definitions around sustainable investment and ESG are becoming clear and investors have frameworks. The EU taxonomy together with the UN SDGs is a solid base fund that fund managers can refer to. In turn, investors can more easily compare fund structures and performance. The situation is far from ideal but it is so much better than a couple of years ago. Thanks to this growing culture amongst investors, to dig deeper, the most egregious greenwashing will gradually disappear.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Where we could turn to be too optimistic<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However rosy this scenario may appear, I can identify three risks that may at least partly derail it. Firstly, traditional polluting industries have benefited over the years from heavy levels of subsidies from Governments because they are large job providers. Oil gets $380bn of subsidies a year worldwide, nearly 3 times as much as clean energy (yes, shocking). It will be politically difficult for Governments to cut those industries adrift too quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, while the number of funds claiming to be sustainable is growing exponentially, the number of assets to invest in remains limited. Anyone wishing to invest in zero-carbon power generation in Europe will likely end up investing in Orsted. It is a fantastic company but it trades on very high multiples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To diversify their portfolio, investors have to consider investing in companies like Enel or Iberdrola who have reduced their emissions drastically but are not zero emitters. This simple example shows the type of dilemma investors will face until they have more assets to invest in that fit tight criteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if big Oil decides to re-direct their investment towards clean energy, they risk overpaying for assets and in turn affecting the value of such assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it\u2019s clear that the positive arguments towards sustainable investment are much more powerful and, having turned mainstream, will be a strong source of performance for investors in the future for decades to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Article first published in Finance Magazine.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You would have needed to be on another planet not to have heard that sustainable investments have outperformed markets since the Covid-19 crisis.

shares, bonds, funds and commodities can be seen as a smart way to grow your money over time. It can help you achieve your personal goals and give you the financial freedom to tick off lifelong dreams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we\u2019ll answer the key questions that many people ask before they start investing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can I invest in?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a wide range of available investments, from businesses to property, cash, commodities and even cryptocurrencies, you can invest in many things. In many cases it is possible to invest directly (i.e. own the physical asset) as well as indirectly (e.g. own shares of a physical asset).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of ways to invest indirectly too. Here are two of the most common indirect investment types:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stocks &amp; shares<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can buy shares in businesses and markets in the hope that their value will increase over time, meaning your investment is worth more than the amount you originally invested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Funds<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also invest in a fund (a collective investment vehicle which \u201cpools\u201d assets), which is made up of a number of assets, whether stocks &amp; shares, property or bonds. This will be looked after by a professional fund manager, who will invest your money usually in one of two ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; An \u2018active\u2019 fund. This aims to outperform the market by actively selecting stocks and shares and\/or other assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; A \u2018passive\u2019 fund. This kind of fund simply tracks an index and could even be structured as an Exchange Traded Fund (or \u201cETF\u201d for short).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How long should I invest for?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing is a personal journey, so the length of time you hold your investment should depend on your own circumstances and what you\u2019re looking to achieve. As a general rule, investments in stocks and shares should be seen as a medium to long term investment. These investments are generally not appropriate to be held over the short term due to the fluctuations in value that can be experienced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing your money for longer periods of time also means your investment may benefit from the compounding effect, which is in short when your investment increases due to interest being earned on accumulated interest. Compounding was described by none other than Albert Einstein and more recently, the legendary investor Warren Buffett as the \u201c8th wonder of the world\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much should I invest?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should only invest from your savings, always making sure that you have enough to fall back on &#8211; at least three months of living expenses is generally considered the general rule of thumb. However, you should also consider your assets to debt ratio. Typically, it is best to repay debt before making investments as the interest on debt can be higher than the returns that can be earned by investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much risk should I take?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every investment carries an element of risk. There are no guarantees and the value of your investment can increase or decrease over time. Investments are not like savings accounts, but at the same time, they are not subject to the same risks of the rate of inflation\/cost of living eroding the real value of your money that can occur by simply leaving your money in cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about risk on a spectrum, from low, to medium, to high. Investments with a lower level of risk typically offer less in returns annually. However they expose investors to a lower level of potential loss than higher risk investments. Higher risk investments often generate higher returns but carry with them higher risk of loss of your initial capital. This is generally viewed as the risk\/reward pay off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where should I invest my money?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think carefully about the types of companies and industries that you want to support. Do you want them to have a social conscience? Do you care if they are a force for positive change in the world? And from an economic perspective, are these businesses likely to grow in coming years or die out as industries focus on becoming sustainable? You should also consider diversification (i.e. different assets, geographies, etc) when considering where to invest your money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One aspect to think about is that with society more aware of its responsibilities than ever, and the impact of environmental, social and governance issues on the environment, long term sustainable investing is becoming an increasingly important consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the investing process?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can breeze through the onboarding process with the aquilax app in just a couple of minutes, choosing your risk profile and how much you want to invest. Lots of people start investing by making use of some or all of their \u00a320,000 stocks &amp; shares ISA allowance. This allowance currently means you won\u2019t pay tax on any profits earned from investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before making your first investment, it\u2019s important that you have a basic understanding of these questions, which we hope will put you in a strong position to start thinking about investing with confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>aquilax Invest is a simple way to invest in a sustainable portfolio of carefully selected companies already making a positive impact on climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Investments of this nature carry risks to your capital.

Opinions are his own.<\/em><\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizenship isn\u2019t a new idea when it comes to climate change. Many people have articulated the need for collaboration, participation and collective effort from individuals, businesses and governments in order to reach our climate goals. And yet, when it comes to creating impact for the environment, many organisations still revert back to doing things for people as Consumers, rather than actively involving people as Citizens in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the world of sustainability talks about Citizens and the world of business talks about Consumers, there will always be a tension that limits what we can achieve &#8211; but there is a solution, and it could start with the very businesses we\u2019re investing in through aquilax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Understanding the Consumer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our world is dominated by the overarching story that the only way we can participate in society or create change is through our consumption. What was initially a liberating shift from the \u2018Subject\u2019 narrative that prevailed prior to the two world wars, has now permeated through all aspects of our involvement in society and become an <strong>identity construct <\/strong>which, especially for our climate, is proving <strong>ultimately unsustainable<\/strong>.<br><br>Every day, we are bombarded by commercial messages reinforcing extrinsic values of consumption, power and competition, reminding us that what we consume is the primary driver of our identity. \u2018Consumer behaviour\u2019 is consistently referred to by companies when deciding what products to develop and is even used as an excuse for inaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help illustrate how this Consumer narrative manifests itself in our everyday lives, have a go at this <strong>quick exercise<\/strong>:<br><br>Think of the last advert or commercial message you saw (or go to a website right now and find one) and look at the table below.<strong> In which column does it position you as the receiver?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/aquilaxinvest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/citizens-vs-consumers.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aquilaxinvest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/citizens-vs-consumers.png 453w, https:\/\/aquilaxinvest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/citizens-vs-consumers-300x263.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll bet that for most, it was in the middle.<br><br>There are gravitational pulls from governments and organisations back towards the Subject and forward towards the Citizen &#8211; but overall, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re living in a Consumer society.<br><br><strong>Why is that a bad thing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct extraction, production and consumption are well known to have massive carbon footprints in \u2018Consumer industries\u2019 such as textiles and food. While these are societal norms, the extent to which the \u2018Consumer\u2019 can effect change will only ever be through changes in consumption, which is likely limited to the privileged few and subject to market forces which prevent large-scale shifts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we think of people as Consumers, it is easy to accept the conventional wisdom that people are selfish, lazy and materialistic. After all, Consumers only do what is<strong> easy<\/strong>, not what\u2019s needed. They take small actions, not big ones. They act as <strong>individuals<\/strong>, not as a collective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, when it comes to solving the climate crisis, the values of the Consumer are fundamentally opposed to the values we need.<br><br>But, <strong>by nature we are Citizens, not Consumers<\/strong>. We are wired for community, not consumption. We are collaborative and empathetic creatures who can and want to work together to make things better. We\u2019ve seen this in times of crisis &#8211; just look at the swathes of people signing up to be NHS Responders or join mutual aid groups during the coronavirus pandemic. As Citizens, we step into our power and work together to make things better, as shown through movements like the Youth Climate Strikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that our capacity to meaningfully contribute in this way is helped or hindered by the systems, structures and at root the narratives we surround ourselves with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When those systems and structures constantly reinforce consumerism, we adopt the mindset of the Consumer, and over time, it sticks. This is a vicious cycle which we need to break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What can businesses do?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses need to deliver sustainable solutions <em>with<\/em> people &#8211; not just <em>for<\/em> them. Whether a business has an environmental mission or not, we can all start building the Citizen narrative in our own ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Start with belief in people<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen, the Consumer will never solve the climate crisis, so we need to believe that there is another option. We need to believe that whilst companies might have the knowledge, expertise and experience to deliver sustainable solutions, they don\u2019t necessarily hold all the answers. People want and need to have a deeper, more meaningful role than just accepting an off-the-shelf solution delivered to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When addressing business challenges &#8211; whether we\u2019re working in sustainability or not &#8211; that belief can be acted on by changing our starting point. Reframing our starting point from \u2018people want to buy stuff\u2019 to \u2018people can and want to get involved in more ways\u2019 is not only a<strong> more interesting place to take your business<\/strong> but will also contribute to the changing narrative of our entire society from Consumer to Citizen, and therefore towards climate action. For example, Brewdog have embraced this approach by genuinely involving their customers in every aspect of the business, from production to ownership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Talk Citizen<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Language is a powerful thing. Research shows that even when we are temporarily primed as Consumers through language, we are less likely to take action for a cause or trust others to do so. Even when we do buy sustainable products or switch to a renewable energy provider, if we do it for reasons that reinforce the importance of things like image, cost or conformity, we\u2019re more likely to make decisions in future that also stem from those values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To break this cycle, we need to change the way we communicate with and talk about people. No matter what we\u2019re selling, we need to promote messages of purpose, community and citizenship, rather than just marketing the product as trendy or a way of making or saving money. By doing so, not only will people buy the product, but they\u2019ll also buy into something bigger and have the agency required to get involved in other ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Become a platform<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we see people as active agents for change and have appropriately adjusted how we communicate with them, the next natural step is to get them involved in whatever it is that we are doing. If you see people as more than Consumers, then the chances are they will do more than just consume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a platform means finding ways for people to contribute in more ways than just by buying a product; it offers opportunities to do things through and with Citizens, rather than just for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some thought-starters for how businesses might open up this space for participation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Tell stories<\/strong>: How might we offer a channel that allows people to share stories of their involvement with our organisation? For example, through a guest blog like this one!<\/li><li><strong>Gather data<\/strong>: How might our community gather and share data to help with our mission?<\/li><li><strong>Share connections<\/strong>: How might we inspire our community to spread our work through their networks?<\/li><li><strong>Contribute ideas<\/strong>: How might we genuinely open up the challenges we face to get more ideas from more people?<\/li><li><strong>Give time<\/strong>: How might we offer meaningful ways that people can use their time, skills and experiences to help us achieve our shared mission?<\/li><li><strong>Learn skills<\/strong>: How might we help people learn and share their relevant skills so that more people can contribute?<\/li><li><strong>Crowdfund<\/strong>: How might we create a new product or service that could be funded and part-owned by our community?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all of them will be right for every company, but I guarantee that everyone can find a way to use at least one of them to make their organisation more participatory and ultimately, reject the narrative that all we want to do is consume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actions explored in this blog won\u2019t change things overnight and I don\u2019t mean to downplay the importance of us all doing our bit. On the contrary, by shifting from doing things <em>for<\/em> or <em>to<\/em> people towards doing things <em>with<\/em> people, there is a really exciting opportunity for businesses &#8211; including but not limited to those we\u2019re investing in through aquilax &#8211; to help create the conditions for more of us to take action for climate both <strong>individually and collectively<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift is all about reimagining the role of people. So, with a nod to the immortal words of JFK: <em>ask not what you can do for <\/em><strong><em>Consumers<\/em><\/strong><em>, ask what <\/em><strong><em>Citizens<\/em><\/strong><em> can do with you.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Would you like to do more as a business or a citizen for our environment?

In fact, they feel more and more like New Year\u2019s resolutions \u2013 they attract attention, create a short-term buzz and the willingness or ability to stick by them can be \u2018patchy\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2010s might have been defined by them and commitments from governments &#8211; often state, provincial and regional governments &#8211; businesses and civil society created the much needed momentum that lead to the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 \u2013 the world\u2019s first ever universal climate change agreement signed by all countries (the effective withdrawal of the United States is not possible before November 4, 2020).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But at the start of the 2020s it\u2019s time to say goodbye to the era of commitments and usher in the era of planetary accountability<\/strong><em>. <\/em>Why? Because commitments have now become near obsolete. Because, more than any previous generation, we know there\u2019s only really one single path forward:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to zero out global greenhouse gas emissions. <em>Net<\/em> zero carbon emissions by mid-century (unavoidable emissions in 2050 must be matched by removing emissions from the atmosphere) and phasing out sources of other man-made greenhouse gases, like methane, by 2070.&nbsp; We need to halt deforestation. We need to preserve and restore natural ecosystems, including our oceans, to grow the world\u2019s carbon sinks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now we know <em>exactly<\/em> where we\u2019re heading, it\u2019s time to rate and reward leaders by their accountability towards that global goal. It\u2019s time to usher in the era of planetary accountability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Planetary not just climate.<\/em> <strong>We are not just witnessing a climate emergency.<\/strong> We are also witnessing a biodiversity crisis and a resource crisis. They all root in the fact that we have disconnected from nature. We have forgotten that everything we use, eat, play with is only possible because of the wealth of resources our planet provides us. Tackling the biodiversity, climate, and resource crises requires transformational change in every sector, across wide-ranging policies and legislations, and will require buy-in from industry, civil society and indigenous groups. It requires solutions that consider the interconnectivity of these crises that are now spilling over into our economic and social wellbeing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Accountability<\/em> because planetaryleaders are no longer defined by their commitments and potential (future) impact. In the era of accountability, <strong>leaders are to be defined by their track record, by their pace of transformational change and their ability to walk the talk.<\/strong> Leaders are to be defined by progress. Leaders clean up the mess they have made in the past. Business leaders take account of climate-related financial risk, disclose scenario models up to 2050, re-engineer their products, and offer to take back any products, materials and resources they put on the market. Governmental leaders legislate for a fundamentally different society by mid-century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>let\u2019s be clear, change is feasible.<\/strong> A lot of the solutions are there, new cleaner and efficient technologies are no longer a futuristic hope, a lot of the policy change has already been suggested. We are seeing momentum shifting, perhaps too slowly, but with more engaged citizens. School children showing they care on the streets and corporate sustainability finally moving from a PR practice into engineering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, the answers cited to our planetary breakdown are often contradictory, nuanced, complex, and disillusioning, focusing on systemic change beyond the control of the average citizen, business executive or legislator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what can we do?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows are solutions for a road to recovery that could be adopted by each and one of us. These solutions don\u2019t discriminate between the global north or the global south \u2013 they tie in planetary recovery with economic development. Equally important, they apply to individual citizens, legislators and business executives. Finally, they are aimed at addressing the climate, biodiversity and resource crises alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Cut waste in every shape or form<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To change course and tackle our climate, biodiversity and resource emergencies and to reach the pace needed, we have to cut out waste from everything we do, invent and legislate. For far too long, we\u2019ve been led to believe that resource substitution combined with recycling makes it all ok \u2013 hardly questioning whether we can avoid something altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Change is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a citizen, by letting go of anything that will have no real impact on your way of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a business executive, by choosing efficiency and product minimization as a driver of your profitability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a legislator, by incentivizing, financing and subsidizing durability so it becomes equitable for all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Put your money where your mouth is<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the climate risks have been well known for a long time, money has continued to flow into investments that are well known to be at the core of those risks and planetary breakdown. To change course and tackle our climate, biodiversity and resource emergencies, we\u2019ve got to put our money where our mouth is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Change is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a citizen, by greening your spending patterns, consider an environmentally friendly bank and invest any savings \u2013 large or small \u2013 in those businesses that are making an impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a business executive, by putting an internal tax on carbon counting for the cost of planetary breakdown in any investment decision. By working with service providers that offer your employees environmentally friendly reward packages and pension products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a legislator by designing stimulus packages with clear planetary performance metrics. By providing clean tax incentives and considering penalty prices on carbon emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Be curious like a kid<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Change can only come from informed decisions. When it comes to green credentials, we haven\u2019t probed deep enough. We haven\u2019t fact-checked exaggerated or absurd claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Change is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a citizen, by constantly questioning companies\u2019 green credentials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a business executive, by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain &#8211; the deeper you get into the supply chain the darker it can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 As a legislator, by incorporating environmental education into the curriculum at schools.&nbsp; By demonstrating how looking after nature is a prerequisite for sustained economic development.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Let\u2019s make full use of the 2020 head start<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve known for a while that 2020 was a crucial year. Failing to peak global emissions in 2020 would put limiting the worst effects of global warming out of our reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the year that goal looked uncertain. And then COVID-19 happened. A lot has been written about short and possible longer-term effects of COVID-19 on greenhouse emissions, behaviour change, and the use of single-use plastics. For some, the glass is half full, for some the glass is half empty. Only time will tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emissions in 2020 will drop. And according to the latest estimates quite substantially \u2013 possibly by more than 7% globally. Emissions could equally rebound quickly \u2013 when economists talk about V or U-shaped recoveries, we could simulate a V or U-shaped rebounding of emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that leaves us with one certainty \u2013 emissions in 2020 will not just peak but fall dramatically. While this drop is for all the wrong reasons, we have been given a head start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s use it wisely and usher in the era of planetary accountability.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JC Seghers is a global changemaker with experience in initiating, scaling up, and delivering on transformational global projects and campaigns unleashing legislation, technology and action to address global warming.

Sustainable Development Goals: how to support them while working from home"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>The UN Sustainable Development Goals are designed as a roadmap for a better planet with a healthier climate.&nbsp;We\u2019ve&nbsp;picked&nbsp;out four of them that you can support, even while working from home!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, member states of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to bring peace and prosperity&nbsp;to the planet and all people. Today, as the world adapts to the impact of Covid-19, this mission could not be more important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sustainabledevelopment.un.org\/?menu=1300\">17 UN Sustainable Development Goals<\/a>, and 169 targets derived from those goals, map out the ambition of the plan.&nbsp;Critical&nbsp;transitions such as improved health, education, ending poverty, and boosting economic growth are among the key areas of focus. Climate action, goal 13, has the potential to affect all the others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question we can ask ourselves today is: <em>\u2018how can I help the world improve and achieve the UN\u2019s mission, in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic?\u2019<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As individual citizens, we have a part to play. To help guide, we\u2019ve chosen&nbsp;four&nbsp;of the goals that we can all support at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Choose energy options that reduce your energy footprint<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>Global Goal 7, Affordable and Clean Energy<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to decarbonize the energy that we use. Together, we can reduce our carbon emissions and keep global temperatures below disastrous levels. Using energy-saving light bulbs and appliances are helpful, but we can do more. Switching to a provider which supplies only renewable energy is also a powerful step.&nbsp;Looking to the future, when we are no longer confined to our homes, we should consider our choice of transport carefully. Choosing an electric vehicle can save up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edfenergy.com\/electric-cars\/environment\">1.5 million grams of CO2 annually<\/a>. That\u2019s the equivalent of four return flights from London to Barcelona.&nbsp;Harnessing the power of the sun to fuel your home is another option. With prices falling and the opportunity to sell your energy back to the grid, domestic solar panels are increasingly attractive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Think local: support your community<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Urban areas are projected to house 60%&nbsp;of the world&#8217;s population by 2030, with&nbsp;one in every three people&nbsp;living&nbsp;in&nbsp;mega-cities with at least half a million inhabitants. Building modern, sustainable cities will be essential in preparing for this surge. Intelligent urban planning will effectively guarantee safe, affordable, green and cultural cities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us are already contributing to this global goal without realising it. By shopping as locally as possible, we are supporting&nbsp;our communities&nbsp;as well as choosing a lower carbon footprint. Whenever you can, choose local food providers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local politics matters as well. Elections have been postponed, giving us more time to reflect on our options. Research your local candidates and make sure you elect the leaders in your local community who will prioritise green solutions as part of their agenda. To support the UN Sustainable Development Goals at home, vote for leaders who support them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Be a responsible consumer; think before you buy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>Global Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 7bn consumers drive the global economy. Every time we purchase something, we make a vote. What does your vote say? Are you voting for a more resource efficient planet?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking responsibility for everyday purchases is essential. We need to start asking where the things we buy come from. Who made them? Are they ethical? Were they shipped thousands of miles by air when I could have purchased locally? What are they made out of?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to think before we buy, especially in the fast-paced world of online shopping: \u201cDo I really need this?\u201d Perhaps you can use something you already have at home, repair it or make your own. DIY recipes can easily be found online for all kinds of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the food we eat has a big impact. Eating less meat, fish and dairy products can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. But you can also cut down on food waste, which contributes to 8% of our total carbon emissions. In Max La Manna\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/More-Plants-Less-Waste-Plant-based\/dp\/1529396204\">\u2018More Plants, Less Waste&#8217;<\/a> book he shows us how to use food scraps like onion skins and celery leaves to make stock. So get creative with your leftovers and reduce your food waste, all from the comfort of your own home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Take action now<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>Global Goal 13, Climate Action<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Action at home starts small, by writing to your local MP. Demand action from the government on the climate emergency. Call for policies that will create lasting, positive change.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspiring speeches might even motivate you to start your own initiative. This could be anything from a \u2018green group\u2019 in your community, planning a fundraising event (later in the year!) or starting a petition. Local networks are key. Invite friends, family and colleagues by speaking to them about climate change and what you can do together to help.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering for projects such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.treesforcities.org\/\">Trees For Cities<\/a> or a citizen science scheme are also effective steps. For the more adventuros, perhaps you could plan for your next (post-isolation!) holiday to involve volunteering with a conservation charity on a rewilding project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, we can support the UN\u2019s mission. Now is the time to give some of these ideas a go, even while working from home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, how you invest your savings can have a big impact. At aquilax, we are driven by sustainability and we\u2019re enabling investment in green energy, clean technology, clean water, sustainable food, recycling, and clean mobility.

are changing quickly and dramatically due to the Covid-19 crisis, at a pace unimaginable just a few weeks ago. Swift government action to adapt our systems has proven that a global response to a global problem is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the <a href=\"https:\/\/aquilaxinvest.com\/about\">aquilax team<\/a>, this raises the important question: <strong>can a response of this scale be repeated for the climate crisis?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Covid-19 and Climate Crisis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both crises are global. No country is immune from either Covid-19 or the effects of climate change. Similarly, they will both impact some countries more severely than others. For example, low altitude nations are at the highest risk of rising sea levels. Nations with rudimentary healthcare systems face more intense challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both crises are pernicious in the scale of potential deaths. Covid-19 has the potential to kill millions of people around the world. The impact of the climate crisis has already cost many lives and has the potential to be very deadly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will witness famine, droughts and longer-lasting heatwaves. By continuing on our current path, global temperatures will increase by more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, triggering lethal scenarios.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economic disruption from both crises is also a grave concern. Estimates are of trillions of dollars of impact resulting from Covid-19.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential economic impact of climate breakdown is also in the trillions, but could end up dwarfing the total damage caused by Covid-19. Climate change threatens so many elements of our society and way of life, that its economic impact is almost immeasurable. Agricultural damage, flooding and power grid disruption alone could knock the world\u2019s economy into a steep decline. Climate-related food shortages could also force tens of millions of people back into poverty, which will lead to increased vulnerability to health problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why such dramatic differences in the responses?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world came to realise the severity of the Covid-19 threat, leaders took drastic action. Lockdowns of cities, restrictions on movement, mass school closures, postponement of sports events (even the Olympic games), and a large reduction in transport use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the starker threat posed by the climate crisis, response from governments has been relatively passive. Our perception of global warming is different to that of a killer virus. Dramatic video footage of floods and bushfires are not necessarily directly associated with climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Governments, businesses and individuals need to look further down the line into the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the means to mitigate dangerous global warming through coordinated global action and a move towards sustainable business models. We need to work together to make sure climate change is no longer perceived as a distant threat by governments, businesses and individuals. Encouragingly, many people are thinking longer term now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the key learning from the Covid-19 response?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Change is possible! The recent upheavals to our way of life haven\u2019t been straightforward, but have proven our capacity to adapt as a society. Social distancing, working from home, supporting vulnerable people, avoiding transport, and an increase in hygiene are all impressive achievements. Factories have converted their production processes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/mar\/17\/uk-manufacturers-regear-factories-build-ventilators-nhs\">in order to provide more ventilators for the NHS<\/a>. We can now confidently say that we can adapt to an altered way of living when necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The reason for hope<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking action on a global scale is possible. This crisis has proven unequivocally that international action can happen quickly and decisively in response to powerful threats.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the current Covid-19 crisis is frightening, we must not lose hope. It is important to recognise that global systems change can happen, and fast. In just a few months, we\u2019ve seen how humanity is capable of incredible feats, innovation and international coordination when it matters most.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission at aquilax Invest is to support innovations designed to combat climate change. Together, through our collective investments, we can enable inspiring organisations to bring about the change we need to tackle the climate crisis head on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer

been almost 50 years since the first Davos conference in 1971, later evolving into the official World Economic Forum in 1987. And for the first time since that gathering, climate change has finally climbed to the top of the agenda. Many would argue that this should\u2019ve happened 5 or even 10 years ago, but at least it has reached the top now.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the climate crisis has been impossible to ignore over the past year. 2019 was the second hottest year on record, extreme weather events have become much more frequent, and Australia has been ravaged by wildfires, made far more likely due to a rise in average temperatures. In many ways, the WEF had no choice; they had to make the climate crisis a top priority this year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what was the outcome? As the world\u2019s political and business leaders converged on the stunning Swiss resort, did they actually make any headway? What can we learn from this first-of-its-kind WEF conference?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are our top takeaways from Davos 2020 and predictions for 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Money talks \u2013 the rising fiscal risks of climate change&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key climate conversation drivers at Davos this year was the ever-rising fiscal risks of the climate crisis. Some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers are beginning to wake up to the significance of climate change and how it will affect international markets over the next decade and beyond. In a statement just before the conference, Blackrock said that climate change has led them to a \u201cfundamental reshaping of finance\u201d and a complete rethink of its strategy as fossil fuels, among other areas, become riskier. Meanwhile, the IMF announced that the crisis \u201calready endangers health and economic outcomes.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, there is a need for a \u201cbetter capitalism\u201d, a term widely used at this year\u2019s Davos. Investors and corporations wield huge power and the ability to enact a new approach; however, the question stemming from this year\u2019s Davos is: will they use this power responsibly or not? Or will governments have to step in?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, there\u2019s no denying the financial risks now. This year\u2019s conference has done a good job at highlighting this. In turn, this focus should provide valuable context as we strive for a more sustainable global system. Next year, we will see this area become even more prominent. Sustainable investing will have further grown in importance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this year the WEF merely talked about the shift towards better investments; it\u2019s time for action to back up the words. This clear takeaway from Davos 2020 helps shape predictions for 2021. Next year, they should be reviewing how far we have shifted, and how this drive for sustainable investing will only increase in the years to come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Greta vs. Trump<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We live in truly bizarre times. This year at Davos, one of the most powerful men in the world, US President Donald Trump, went toe to toe with 17-year-old climate activist and global green icon Greta Thunberg. Who could have predicted this 10 years ago?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greta\u2019s message to the WEF was clear. The science from the IPCC shows an urgent need to act now and stop emissions. Strong words here:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear. We don\u2019t need a \u2018low carbon economy\u2019. We don\u2019t need to \u2018lower emissions\u2019. Our emissions have to stop if we are to have a chance to stay below the 1.5-degree target. And, until we have the technologies that at scale can put our emissions to minus, then we must forget about net zero. We need real zero.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This was followed by three demands:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction&nbsp;<\/li><li>Immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies&nbsp;<\/li><li>Immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump hit back by criticising Greta and her fellow activists, ridiculing them and their demands as <em>\u201cprophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse\u201d.<\/em> This was then backed up by Steven Mnuchin, US Secretary of the Treasury, who highlighted how Greta wasn\u2019t a qualified economist and therefore shouldn\u2019t be commenting on the matter. Clearly, the current leaders in the US aren\u2019t going to move on the issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a green-focussed Democrat, such as Sanders, Warren or Bloomberg, is elected later this year, this would provide a much stronger platform for further climate action. It could be argued that the upcoming US Presidential election in November is the most important ever. While Trump\u2019s continued climate inaction was one of the key takeaways from Davos 2020, predictions for 2021 depend dramatically on the election\u2019s outcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. The science is brutally clear, and the WEF knows it<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the IPCC said that the world had a limit of 420 gigatons of carbon to emit if we are to have a 67% chance of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees. This figure is now down to 340 gigatons. As a result, warming over 2.0 degrees is looking more likely than ever before. This is highly distressing, but there is hope. The good news is that this Davos was like no other. Meaningful commitments are finally being made. For example, even the Trump-led US is joining the One Trillion Trees Initiative, which could make a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg24532640-800-planting-a-trillion-trees-really-can-help-us-fight-climate-change\/\">\u201chuge difference if we do it right\u201d<\/a>. In the face of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/reports\/\">overwhelming scientific evidence<\/a>, the penny has seemingly (finally) dropped for more leaders than last year, causing perhaps the most sombre mood at the conference in recent memory. However, there is still a very long way to go, and urgent action is needed, but at least there\u2019s no dodging the topic now. The scrutiny has never been higher, largely thanks to the efforts of relentless activism, brilliant scientific research and bold financial moves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we look ahead, we can expect even higher scrutiny and pressure on leaders to back up their words from this year. The calls for sustainable investing, divestment from fossil fuels, better food systems, and innovations in transport will be even stronger. Let us hope that when Davos 2021 comes about, we\u2019ll have seen far more action than words, and stronger, smarter leadership from all countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>aquilax Invest\u2019s CEO Duncan Grierson shares his thoughts on Davos 2020 and predictions for Davos
